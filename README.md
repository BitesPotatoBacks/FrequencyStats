## Project Deets
Once upon a time, I created a command line tool, the [SocPowerBuddy](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/SocPowerBuddy); the soul purpose of which was to provide _real_ per-core frequency metrics on Apple Silicon without needing sudo. I thought that it would be cool to make an efficient little menu bar app based on it, which doesn't need a daemon or a kext!

I hope to add Intel support someday, but to follow my personal rule for this project, it needs to be a rootless implementation...

### Features
The current feature set covers cluster frequencies and state distribution, per-core frequencies with colorized meters (for CPUs), and colorized per-cluster graphs (that I need to expand on)...

### WIP Features
- [ ] Extended scrollable history for graphs
- [ ] CSV Dumping
- [ ] Menubar Widgets
